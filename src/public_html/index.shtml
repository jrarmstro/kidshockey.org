					Hello Kids,
					<br><br>
					After 25 years of Kids Christian Hockey League, we have made the difficult decision to
					stop operations – there will be no KCHL this year or in the coming years.
					<br><br>
					Our work and personal lives have changed in the past two years and it has become more
					difficult to commit the time needed to run the league.
					<br><br>
					We will be communicating in the coming weeks for those who would like one last exchange of
					equipment before that part of our program is shut down as well.
					<br><br>
					We can’t begin to thank our coaches and volunteers from the past 25 years but we know that
					this league would not exist without all of them/you – thank you.
					<br><br>
					Every year Sponsors supported our league to keep costs affordable.  Some of these Sponsors
					were noted at various points in time during Awards events and on Sweaters.  Other Sponsors
					wished to remain anonymous – Thank You All.
					<br><br>
					Finally, thank you to the 1000’s of kids who showed up at the rink ready to learn and play
					the game.
					<br><br>
					Paul Armstrong / Randy Hopkins
